# Introduction 

This guide describes the information about setting up a Gmail account, add and edit contacts, and edit mail settings.

# Setting up a Gmail account 

To create a Gmail address, you need to create a Google account. Gmail will redirect you to the Google account sign-up page. You need to provide some basic information like your name, birth date, gender, and location. You also need to choose a name for your new Gmail address. Once you create an account, you can start adding contacts and adjusting your mail settings. 

## To create an account: 
1. Go to [Gmail Website](https://www.gmail.com). 
2. Click **Create account**.

 8. Your account is created.
 
# Signing in to your account

When you first create your account, you will be automatically signed in. Most of the time, however, you'll need to sign in to your account and sign out when you're done with it.

## To sign in:

1. Go to [Gmail Website](https://www.gmail.com).
2. Type your **user name** (your email address) and **password**, then click **Next**.

## To sign out:

In the top-right corner of the page, locate the circle that has your first initial (if you've already selected an avatar image, it will show the image instead). To sign out, click the circle and select **Sign out**.

# Mail settings

Occasionally, you may want to make adjustments to Gmail's appearance or behavior. For example, you could create a signature or vacation reply, edit your labels, or change the theme. These adjustments can be made from your mail settings.

## To access your mail settings:

1. Click the gear icon in the top-right corner of the page, then select **Settings**.

# Adding contacts

Like all major email providers, Gmail lets you keep an address book of contacts so you don't have to memorize everyone's email addresses. You can also add other contact information, like phone numbers, birthdays, and physical addresses.

## To add a contact:

1. Click the **Google apps** button.

## To edit a contact:

1. In the Google apps drop-down menu, select **Contacts**.

3. You can now make any changes you want to the contact.

NOTE: By default, when you send an email to a new address, Gmail adds the address to your contacts. You can then go to your contacts to edit the person's information as needed.

# Importing mail and contacts

You may already have a contact list from another email address, and it would be a lot of work to re-enter all of this information manually. Gmail allows you to import your contacts from another email account, and you can even import all of your email messages from that account.

## To add other accounts:

1. Click the gear icon in the top-right corner of the page, then select **Settings**.
2. Go to Accounts and click **Add a mail account**. You can then follow the instructions on the screen to import your mail.
