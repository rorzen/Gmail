# Setting up a Gmail account 

To create a Gmail address, you need to create a Google account. Gmail will redirect you to the Google account sign-up page. You need to provide some basic information like your name, birth date, gender, and location. You also need to choose a name for your new Gmail address. Once you create an account, you can start adding contacts and adjusting your mail settings.
